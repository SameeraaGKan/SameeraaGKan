## Hi there, I'm Sameeraa👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects.
- 🌱 Currently exploring Python, Web-development.
- 👯 I’m looking forward to collaborate for projects
- 💬 Talk to me about my projects or for future ones.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm fluent in three languages 🏞️
- Here's a quote I found interesting:
- ✨Software is like entropy:
     It is difficult to grasp, weighs nothing, and obeys the Second Law of Thermodynamics;
     i.e., it always increases.✨
