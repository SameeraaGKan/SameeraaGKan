## Hi there, I'm Sameeraa👋
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects and upgrading my skills
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, React.js, Web development, JS, django.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on side projects
- 🤔 I've experience with Python, C++, C, Java, HTML, CSS, JS.
- 💬 Talk to me about anything! I'm a great listener.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm fluent in three languages and LOVE Nature 🏞️
- Here's a quote I found interesting:
- -Software is like entropy: It is difficult to grasp, weighs nothing, and obeys the Second Law of Thermodynamics; i.e., it always increases.
